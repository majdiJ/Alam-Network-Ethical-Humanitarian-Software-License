# Alam Network: Ethical Humanitarian Software License (ANEHSL)  - Version 1.1, January 2025

The **Alam Network: Ethical Humanitarian Software License (ANEHSL)** is a license created to promote the responsible, ethical, and humanitarian use of software developed by Alam Network. The aim of this license is to ensure that the software is used in ways that benefit society, without supporting harmful or oppressive applications.

By adopting ANEHSL, users agree to the ethical guidelines outlined within, which prohibit the software's use for military, law enforcement, or other harmful purposes. The license encourages the development and sharing of software with the greater good in mind, and it ensures that all derivative works are publicly accessible and align with its core values.

### Key Features of ANEHSL:

1. **Ethical Restrictions**: The license forbids the use of the software in military, law enforcement, or any activities that threaten civil liberties, justice, or individual freedoms. These restrictions also apply to derivative works.
2. **Encouraging Positive Use**: The software is allowed for civilian, educational, humanitarian, and corporate use that aligns with ethical principles. Government use is permitted only when it explicitly promotes civil liberties, public safety (non-military), humanitarian objectives, or educational purposes in public or private institutions.
3. **Derivative Works**: Modifications are permitted but must be shared under the same license, ensuring continued accessibility and transparency. The source code for any modified or derivative works must be made publicly available, and significant modifications must be shared under the same license. All modifications must be hosted on a publicly accessible and searchable platform.
4. **Attribution and Licensing**: Credit to the original creators is required, and any changes to the license must be documented. Redistribution of the original or modified software must include the full license and proper attribution. Users must maintain the license terms and include clear attribution to the original creators.
5. **Global Applicability**: Designed to be globally applicable, with the aim of ensuring that the software is used for the benefit of humanity, regardless of geography. The license applies to the source code, images, schematics, plans, and other digital content created under its protection.
6. **No Warranty**: The software is provided "as-is," without any warranty of any kind. The authors are not responsible for any damages or issues arising from the use of the software.
7. **Patent License**: By distributing the software or derivative works, users grant a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free patent license to use, modify, and distribute the software. No patents may be imposed that would restrict users' freedom to use or modify the software.
8. **Hardware Requirements**: If the software is used in hardware, the hardware must allow users to install modified versions of the software, preventing restrictions on modified versions of the software (similar to the GPLv3).
